	// state of an operation, operation might be in various states, PENDING - this operation is pending for being submitted. RUNNING - this operation is actively doing its job, COMPLETED - this operation has finished successfully, CANCELLED - this operation was interrupted while being run, FAILED - this operation has finished errorneously 
	State string `json:"state"`

	CreationTime string `json:"creationTime"`
	// timestamp telling when this operation was started by Sidecar, if an operation is created, it does not necessarily mean that it will be started right away, in most cases it is the case but if e.g. ExecutorService is full on its working thread, an execution of an operation is postponed and start time is updated only after that 
	StartTime string `json:"startTime,omitempty"`
	// timestamp telling when an operation has finished, irrelevant of its result, an operation can be failed and it would still have this field populated. 
	CompletionTime string `json:"completionTime,omitempty"`
